# Dogey, a pythonic <a href='https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse'>dogehouse</a> API

## IMPORTANT

* ### As many of you already know, dogehouse is shutting down. If it stays up, I may reconsider continuing this API. Till then, I'll wait without commiting.

## Reasons to use Dogey

* ### Easy adaptability owing to similar syntax to other famous APIs such as [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

* ### Always updated with the latest additions to dogehouse

* ### High performance since less packages are imported and expensive variables are rate-limited

## Screenshots

* ### The default help command of the [basic commands example](https://github.com/Shadofer/dogey/blob/pre-release/examples/basic_commands.py)
