# Ways to contribute to Dogey

## Make changes to the API

### Steps

* #### ```git clone https://github.com/Shadofer/dogey.git```

* #### ```cd {dogey directory}```

* #### ```git switch pre-release``` to first put the PRs in a testing phase.

* #### ```pip install -e .``` Optional but speeds up changes(modifies the Dogey package everytime it's updated locally).

* #### Change anything you want, which makes sense.

### Needed structure of changes

* #### [Maintain pythonic code practises.](https://www.codementor.io/blog/pythonic-code-6yxqdoktzt)

* #### Docstrings in each and every new method/variable(only in api.py Dogey.init).

* #### Explain your code, at times, and your target in small comments.
